<!-- OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION FROM INSTRUCTOR -->
## Offical description from instructor

__Multi-class classification of impressionist painters__

So far in class, we've been working with 'toy' datasets - handwriting, cats, dogs, and so on. However, this course is on the application of computer vision and deep learning to cultural data. This week, your assignment is to use what you've learned so far to build a classifier which can predict artists from paintings.

You can find the data for the assignment here: https://www.kaggle.com/delayedkarma/impressionist-classifier-data

Using this data, you should build a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks which classify paintings by their respective artists. Why might we want to do this? Well, consider the scenario where we have found a new, never-before-seen painting which is claimed to be the artist Renoir. An accurate predictive model could be useful here for art historians and archivists!

For this assignment, you can use the CNN code we looked at in class, such as the ShallowNet architecture or LeNet. You are also welcome to build your own model, if you dare - I recommend against doing this.

Perhaps the most challenging aspect of this assignment will be to get all of the images into format that can be fed into the CNN model. All of the images are of different shapes and sizes, so the first task will be to resize the images to have them be a uniform (smaller) shape.

You'll also need to think about how to get the images into an array for the model and how to extract 'labels' from filenames for use in the classification report

__Tips__

* You should save visualizations showing loss/accuracy of the model during training; you should also a save the output from the classification report
* I suggest working in groups for this assignment. The data is quite large and will take some time to move over to worker02. Similarly training the models will be time consuming, so it is preferably to have fewer models on the go.
* You might want to consider a division of labour in your group. One person working on resizing images, one working on extracting labels, one developing the model, etc.
* For reshaping images, I suggest checking out cv.resize() with the cv2.INTER_AREA method
* If you have trouble doing this on your own machines, use worker02
* Don't worry if the results aren't great! This is a complex dataset we're working with

__General instructions__

* Save your script as cnn-artists.py
* If you have external dependencies, you must include a requirements.txt
* You can either upload the script here or push to GitHub and include a link - or both!
* Your code should be clearly documented in a way that allows others to easily follow along
* Similarly, remember to use descriptive variable names! A name like X_train is (just) more readable than x1

__Purpose__

This assignment is designed to test that you have a understanding of:

* how to build and train deep convolutional neural networks;
* how to preprocess and prepare image data for use in these models;
* how to work with complex, cultural image data, rather than toy datasets

<!-- HOW TO RUN -->
## How to run

__NOTICE:__ To run the assignment, you need to have configured and activated your virtual environment. See the main [README](https://github.com/JohanHorsmans/cds-visual-exam-2021/blob/main/README.md) for a guide on how to do this.

Go through the following steps to run assignment 5:
```bash
cd {root directory (i.e. cds-visual-exam-2021}
cd assignment_5
python3 cnn-artists.py
```
Type: ```python3 cnn-artists.py -h``` for a detailed guide on how to specify script-parameters.
