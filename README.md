<!-- PROJECT INFO -->
## Project info

This repository houses the exam of _Johan Kresten Horsmans (AU ID: 618771)_ for the course [_Visual Analytics_](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/101992/Visual-Analytics), as part of the bachelor's elective [_Cultural Data Science_](https://bachelor.au.dk/en/supplementary-subject/culturaldatascience/) at Aarhus University. The repository consists of 4 projects: three class assignments and one self-assigned project. The following README details how to run the code and contains a thorough explanation of how the repository is structured.

The assignments included in this portfolio are the following:
* Assignment 2 - _Image search_
* Assignment 4 - _Logistic Regression and Neural Network benchmark mnist classification_
* Assignment 5 - _CNN classification of impressionist paintings_
* Self-assigned - _something fucking sick_

<!-- HOW TO RUN -->

__MAC/LINUX/WORKER02__
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohanHorsmans/cds-visual-exam-2021.git
cd cds-visual
bash ./create_vis_venv.sh
```
__WINDOWS:__
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohanHorsmans/cds-visual-exam-2021.git
cd cds-visual
bash ./create_vis_venv_win.sh
```
